# CSV data files

The CSV folder contains ungulate trait data, trait definitions, and trait sources, all in comma-separated file form.

- [Trait data](ungulatesTraits.csv)
- [Trait definitions](ungulatesTraitsDefinitions.csv)
- [Trait_sources](ungulatesTraits_sources.csv)

The relevant variables in the trait data were chosen with the help of literature study, and the PanTHERIA, EoL and
ADW databases. There are a couple of trait categories in which the hypothesized predictor variables are found: diet, 
growth rate, mating procedure, nervousness, nature and social structure. From these categories, measurable traits were 
formulated. These selected traits were merged with traits from the [PanTHERIA data file](../PanTHERIA.tsv) and 
niche traits obtained by Elke Hendrix using OMI transformation of GIS pixel values at occurrence locations (which can 
be found here: 
https://github.com/naturalis/trait-geo-diverse-ungulates/blob/master/results/OMI/niche_traits.csv).
